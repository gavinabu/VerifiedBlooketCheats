# Verified Blooket Cheats
I have made plenty of private blooket cheats, and have first hand seen people get account hacked/banned. I want to make a system where I can verify blooket cheats and offer reasurance and proof that some cheats are legit, or viruses.

As always even if somebody says that a cheat is safe, dont belive anybody, I could just be someones alt account. _**I always recommend running cheats in an incognito tab, logged out of your account. I understand you won't get your coins, but it's better than losing your account, or getting banned.**_

Also on any of these repo's that have their issues page public I will post these recommendations as an issue as well.\
Owners. I would recommend pinning said issues since It is a great thing to see as a user.

It is usually a long file so I would reccomend to use "CTRL+F" and search for keywords like ["discord", "webhook", "token", "jwt", "cookies"]\
However before I put any of these on this list I will always go line by line, but that is a good way to just get a decent idea of if something is safe or not.\
If any of these terms show up. DO NOT CALL IT OUT FOR BEING A CHEAT. some of these can be used for analytics purposes or in other ways like for authentication or chat. Please talk to somebody(like me) who is moderatly expierenced with blooket cheats, javascript, or websecurity in general. I have make plenty of private blooket cheats and know what a token grabber looks like.

I would be very careful with blooket cheats since most of them are token grabbers. ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE OBFUSCATED. Big red flag. Especially on github where there is a big focus on open source. This technically goes against the Terms of Service.

If a cheat is obfuscated I have found this website is amazing. https://obf-io.deobfuscate.io/

I will often only check the gui.js, any other files are not reviewed. Please use caution.

If anybody would like to suggesst github repo's, I would be happy to review them. Or if developers would like me to re-evaluate their project I will be happy to. However the original rankning will forever remain visible.

I would also not trust any outdated reviews by me. I will try to update them as soon as I can, but I am doing this on my own time. If anybody would like to submit a PR, I will review it and just skim over the deobfuscated code.

[Swagger's GUI](https://github.com/KindleKid/Blooket-Cheat-GUI-aka-Swaggers-GUI) (obfuscated, private issues)   Last checked. April 28 (commit cad8b8b, latest commit was just for the readme so I ignored it)
[TienD2012's Creats](https://github.com/TienD2012/hack-Blooket/issues/1) (obfuscated)   Last checked. April 28 (commit f031319), I am not sure if these are the originals since they were very recently uploaded.
